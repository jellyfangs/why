Serving as a Marine Corps combat engineer during the Global War on Terror was a defining period in my life. The role required a combination of technical skills and mental toughness, as we were responsible for constructing and demolishing obstacles, clearing mines, and ensuring the safety of our fellow Marines. 

The experience taught me invaluable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and resilience under pressure. Being in the field, often in hostile environments, required quick thinking and the ability to stay calm under fire. It was a time of intense challenge and sacrifice, but it also instilled a deep sense of purpose and pride in serving my country. 

The skills and discipline I gained during my service continue to influence my approach to problem-solving and leadership in my professional life today.
